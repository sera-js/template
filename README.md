## ⚙️ Core Concepts

### 🔄 Signal-Based Reactivity

SeraJS uses a **signal-based reactive system**, a modern approach to state management that enables efficient updates:

- **Signals**  
  Self-contained reactive values that notify subscribers when they change.

- **Effects**  
  Functions that automatically re-execute when their dependencies (signals) change.

- **Fine-grained updates**  
  Only the specific DOM elements affected by state changes are updated, resulting in minimal re-rendering and high performance.
